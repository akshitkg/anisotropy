### For spatial data
    1. Ripley K-function
    2. L function
    3. Pair correlation function
    4. Nearest neighbour analysis
    5. Spatial auto-correlation
    6. Kernel density estimation

    7. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)


Steps for K-function
1. generate a random point distribution image of the same dimension and number of points as the provided svg image
2. 


Objective:
To implement complete analysis of point data using Ripley K-function

- Ripley K-function 

some innacuracy in reading number of points
distribution plotting




for omnidirectional K-function:
given: coordinates
- 


I have points in an image, i want to implement K-function on it to check the distribution pattern of the points
